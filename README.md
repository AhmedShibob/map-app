## Hello there 

I used Nuxt.js here instead of Vue.js to speed up the development time 

also, I used tailwind CSS 

and Leaflet for maps  

I didn't waste the time storing the data in local storage because it's so easy and I'm so busy

I wanted to use cypress for testing but sorry I have to back to my work Now

and finally I relly enjoyed working in this task.
